# RoboCup SSL Software Team Recruitment Tasks 2025-26

Welcome to the recruitment process for the RoboCup SSL Software team! This repository contains two tasks designed to evaluate your understanding of computer vision, machine learning, and data processing in the context of robotic soccer.

## Task 1: Ball Detection Dataset & Model Training

### Overview
In this task, you will:
- **Create a Ball Detection Dataset**
  - Use Roboflow to build your own dataset for ball detection
  - Limited to 20 images maximum
  - Focus on understanding the basics of dataset creation

- **Train a Detection Model**
  - Train your model using free GPU resources (Kaggle or Google Colab)
  - Optionally incorporate open source datasets
  - Extra points for well-curated datasets

### Deliverables
- Trained model file (`.pt`, `.pth`, `.bin`, `.onnx`, `.t5`, or other standard format)
- Screenshot of your Roboflow dataset
- Link to any open source dataset used (if applicable)
- Brief explanation of your methodology and approach

## Task 2: RoboCup SSL Log Processing & ML Application

### Overview
In this task, you will:
- **Create a Data Pipeline**
  - Convert RoboCup SSL log files (`.log.gz` format) to CSV
  - Process data from official logs (2016-2024) available [here](https://cloud.robocup.org/s/2mkwfxZjPf6NBPS)
  
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Analyze the processed data to understand patterns and insights
  - Create at least 3 visualization diagrams
  
- **Develop ML/DL Models**
  - Train models for any purpose within the RoboCup domain
  - Suggested applications: pass prediction, shot prediction, tackling, goalkeeping, etc.

### Deliverables
- Comprehensive project documentation
- At least 3 EDA visualization diagrams
- System diagram for your ML process
- Detailed reasoning for your methodology choices
- Discussion of potential improvements
- Sample trained model(s)

## Resources
- [RoboCup SSL Official Repository](https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL)
- Free tools: Kaggle, Google Colab, Roboflow

## Notes
- We prioritize methodology and creativity over extensive resources or perfect results
- Small models and datasets are acceptable and encouraged
- Demonstrate your ability to understand and work with the tools and data
- Show your passion for engaging with the problem domain

Good luck with your submission! If you have any questions, please reach out through the appropriate channels.
