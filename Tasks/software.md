# RoboCup SSL Software Team Recruitment Tasks 2025-26
Welcome to the recruitment process for the RoboCup SSL Software team! This repository contains two tasks designed to evaluate your understanding of computer vision, machine learning, and data processing in the context of robotic soccer.

## Task 1: Ball Detection Dataset & Model Training
### Overview
In this task, you will:
- **Create a Ball Detection Dataset**
  - Use Roboflow to build your own dataset for ball detection
  - Limited to 20 images maximum
  - Focus on understanding the basics of dataset creation
- **Train a Detection Model**
  - Train your model using free GPU resources (Kaggle or Google Colab)
  - Optionally incorporate open source datasets
  - Extra points for well-curated datasets
### Deliverables
- Trained model file (`.pt`, `.pth`, `.bin`, `.onnx`, `.t5`, or other standard format)
- Screenshot of your Roboflow dataset
- Link to any open source dataset used (if applicable)
- Brief explanation of your methodology and approach

## Task 2: Soccer Database Analysis & ML Application
### Overview
In this task, you will work with the European Soccer Database available on Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer

- **Perform Basic Data Exploration**
  - Load and explore the database structure (tables, relationships)
  - Check data quality (missing values, duplicates)
  - Describe basic statistics of key variables
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Create at least 3 visualizations that provide insights into soccer matches, players, or teams
  - Suggested topics:
    - Home advantage analysis
    - Player attributes distribution
    - Team performance trends over seasons
    - Match statistics correlations
  
- **Simple ML Application** (Optional)
  - Develop a basic ML model for one of the following:
    - Match outcome prediction (Home win, Draw, Away win)
    - Player rating prediction based on attributes
    - Team strength estimation
    - Goal scoring probability

### Deliverables
- Jupyter notebook showing your data exploration and analysis
- At least 3 visualization diagrams with interpretations
- Brief explanation of your methodology and findings
- If attempting the ML part:
  - Feature selection justification
  - Model choice explanation
  - Basic performance metrics

## Resources
- [European Soccer Database on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer)
- Free tools: Kaggle, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Notes
- We prioritize methodology and clear understanding over complex analysis
- Focus on communicating your findings effectively
- Show your ability to extract meaningful insights from sports data
- You don't need to analyze the entire database - choose specific aspects that interest you
- Time management is important - complete the basic requirements before attempting optional tasks

Good luck with your submission! If you have any questions, please reach out through the appropriate channels.
