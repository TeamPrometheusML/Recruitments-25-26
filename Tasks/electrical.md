# Electrical Recruitment Task 2025-26

Welcome to the recruitment process for the RoboCup SSL Electrical team! This repository contains two tasks designed to evaluate your understanding of electrical engineering concepts, circuit design, and hardware integration in the context of robotic soccer.

## Task 1: Environmental Probe Development  

### Overview  
In this task, you will:  

- **Develop an Environmental Probe in TinkerCAD**  
  - Use [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com) to create a virtual environmental probe.  
  - Utilize **as many sensors as possible** to collect detailed environmental data.  
  - Code the probe using **Arduino's programming language (C/C++)**.   

- **Visualize and Output Data**  
  - Implement **State Indicators** such as LEDs and buzzers to represent sensor readings.  
  - Display collected environmental data on the **Serial Monitor** for real-time observation.  

### Clarification  
An **Environmental Probe** is a device designed to collect atmospheric data from its surroundings. It gathers essential information needed to evaluate conditions for sustaining life in different environments.  

### Deliverables  
- A complete **TinkerCAD circuit design** with multiple sensors and indicators.  
- **Code implementation** in the TinkerCAD simulation environment.  
- A **detailed documentation report** including:  
  - **Why you chose each sensor** and its relevance to environmental monitoring.  
  - **How the data is processed and interpreted**.  
  - **The significance of the collected data** in assessing environmental conditions.  
  - **This documentation should clearly explain the purpose of each component and its role in the overall system.**  



## Task 2: Single-Layer PCB Design  

### Overview  
In this task, you will:  

- **Design a Single-Layer PCB**  
  - Use **KiCad, Eagle, or any PCB design tool** to create a **compact and functional PCB**.  
  - Integrate a **microcontroller (ESP32, Arduino, or ATmega328)** with essential components.  
  - Ensure proper **trace routing, power distribution, and component placement**.  

- **Implement an Environmental Sensor Interface**  
  - Include a **temperature sensor (LM35 or DHT11)** to collect environmental data.  
  - Add **State Indicators** such as LEDs or buzzers to visualize sensor readings.  
  - Connect components efficiently while maintaining a **clean PCB layout**.  

### Clarification  
A **Single-Layer PCB** is a printed circuit board with conductive traces on only one side. The goal is to create a **functional and well-structured PCB** while ensuring **optimal component placement and routing efficiency**.  

### Deliverables  
- A **fully designed PCB layout** in **KiCad, Eagle, or any preferred PCB design software**.  
- **Schematic diagram** showing the circuit connections.  
- **Exported Gerber files** ready for fabrication.  
- A **detailed documentation report** including:  
  - **Why you selected each component** and its role in the circuit.  
  - **How the PCB layout was optimized** for performance and space efficiency.  
  - **Challenges faced and how they were addressed** in the design.  
  - **This documentation should clearly explain the purpose of each component and its role in the overall system.**
