# Electrical Recruitment Task 2025-26

Welcome to the recruitment process for the RoboCup SSL Electrical team! This repository contains two tasks designed to evaluate your understanding of electrical engineering concepts, circuit design, and hardware integration in the context of robotic soccer.

## Task 1: Motor Control System Design

### Overview
In this task, you will:
- **Design a Motor Control Circuit**
  - Create a schematic for a brushless DC motor control system
  - Focus on efficient power delivery and precise control
  - Include necessary protection circuits and feedback mechanisms
  
- **Simulate Your Design**
  - Use simulation software (e.g., LTspice, MATLAB, or other free alternatives)
  - Demonstrate performance under various load conditions
  - Evaluate power efficiency and response time

### Deliverables
- Complete circuit schematic (PDF or standard CAD format)
- Simulation results with performance analysis
- Bill of Materials (BOM) with estimated costs
- Brief explanation of your design choices and trade-offs

## Task 2: Sensor Integration & Data Acquisition

### Overview
In this task, you will:
- **Design a Sensor Integration System**
  - Create a solution for integrating multiple sensors (IMU, encoders, etc.)
  - Develop a data acquisition strategy for real-time processing
  - Focus on noise reduction and signal integrity
  
- **Implement Communication Protocol**
  - Design a communication system between sensors and main controller
  - Balance between speed, reliability, and power efficiency
  - Consider electromagnetic interference in a competition environment

### Deliverables
- System architecture diagram
- Circuit design for sensor integration
- Communication protocol specification
- Sample code for data acquisition (if applicable)
- Analysis of potential failure modes and mitigation strategies

## Resources

- Free tools: KiCad, LTspice, Fusion 360 (educational license)
- [RoboCup SSL Rules](https://ssl.robocup.org/rules/)

## Notes
- We prioritize practical knowledge and problem-solving approach over expensive equipment
- Creative solutions within constraints are highly valued
- Demonstrate your understanding of electrical engineering principles
- Show your ability to design systems that integrate with the larger robotic platform

Good luck with your submission! If you have any questions, please reach out through the appropriate channels.
